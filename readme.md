# OpenRCT2: Android improvements
This build of openrct2 is not made for general usage on all platforms, instead only focusing on trying to make the game more usuable on smart phones.<br><br>

Quality is not to be expected<br>
## Update information
Generally speaking, this wont be 100% up to date with develop, unless a new network code version is released. Since this was made with multiplayer in mind, updates shall be released then with the new network stuff.<br>
## Current Additions
[x] Mute button now opens chat<br>
[x] Moved build and path buttons to the left side of the screen<br>
[x] Made news button into close all windows
